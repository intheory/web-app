title|Concentration: What You Need Most To Drive
content|<p>Driving is like a video game.  Yeah, you&rsquo;ve got to concentrate on where you&rsquo;re going – and maybe your friends are being dumb and loud in the background – but you&rsquo;ve also got to <strong>concentrate </strong>on what&rsquo;s going on around you, because you never know when it will change.  Just because that guard is behind you doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not a threat, and if he comes out of nowhere, you want to be ready—so you want to be <strong>concentrating</strong>.</p>

title|Keeping an Eye on Other Drivers
content|<p>When you drive, sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to do things that might confuse other drivers.  Check first to make sure that causing them a little confusion isn&rsquo;t going to hurt anyone.  If you&rsquo;re moving off, stopping, turning and changing lanes, check up on the cars around you by:</p><ul><li>Checking in the <strong>mirrors</strong> to see who&rsquo;s behind you (and that they&rsquo;re not too close)</li><li>Double-checking before you do anything, just in case (and be careful of those pesky windscreen pillars, which can make it hard to see)</li><li><strong>USING YOUR TURN SIGNAL</strong>.  This is not like giving information to the enemy, we promise. </li><li>If you&rsquo;re reversing and can&rsquo;t see, get someone to help guide you.  Preferably someone who isn&rsquo;t an idiot and who won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s funny to send you into a lamppost.</li></ul><p>So all this checking is great in theory—but what about when parked cars are blocking your view at a junction?<br><strong>Inching forward</strong> is the best plan here, until you can see properly!</p>

title|Fun with Overtaking 
content|<p>Another potentially confusing situation is overtaking.  Beyond the potential social awkwardness (sorry mate, you&rsquo;re slow) is the real danger of having two cars in a part of the road designed for just one—so be <strong>super careful when overtaking</strong>.</p><strong><em>Your Overtaking Checklist:</em></strong><br>□ The road ahead is clear and straight and you can see what&rsquo;s going on<br>□ You have plenty of time to get all the way past<br>□ The other drivers realize you&rsquo;re there and won&rsquo;t be terrified when you pop out of nowhere

title|Times You Get To Be Loud or Unseasonably Bright
content|<p>Streetlights are controlled by people (and sometimes even computers) so they definitely aren&rsquo;t the experts about when it&rsquo;s dark.  Once you start to feel like it&rsquo;s at all hard to see, <strong>turn on your lights</strong>, regardless of what the streetlights are doing.</p><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a good idea to be loud—like when you&rsquo;re crossing a hump bridge.  Honk your horn so other drivers know you&rsquo;re coming even if they can&rsquo;t see you!</p>

title|What Road Signs are For
content|<p>Road signs aren&rsquo;t just there for decoration (even though obviously they&rsquo;re sooo pretty)—they&rsquo;re there to give you information, especially about possible danger.  A few key rules for road signs:</p><ul><li>Well, first of all… <strong>listen to the signs.  </strong>If they stay stop, stop.  If they say yield, yield.  If they set a certain speed limit, obey it.</li><li><strong>Slow down</strong> if there are any hazards.</li><li><strong>Watch the other cars</strong>. This will help you outsmart them if they do anything strange or create a dangerous situation.</li></ul>

title|Watch Out for the Big Guys…
content|<p>Keep your distance from large vehicles!  If you can&rsquo;t see their mirrors, they can&rsquo;t see you—and if they can&rsquo;t see you, you are in danger of getting squashed.  Plus, the farther back you are, the more of the road ahead you&rsquo;ll actually be able to see.</p>

content|<p>Compared to an 18-wheeler, you might not feel like the big guy on the road—but compared to some of the other people on the road, you&rsquo;re a hulking monster.</p><p> Be especially careful for:</p><ul><li>Pedestrians: especially where they might be hard to see, or tempted to cross</li><li>Cyclists: they can be a bit indecisive, so give them plenty of room</li><li>Motorcyclists: check twice, save a life! They find their way into your blind spot easily.</li></ul>

title|Stop!
content|<p>As you&rsquo;ve probably figured out, green traffic lights don&rsquo;t always stay green.  When you&rsquo;re approaching, be ready to stop if they <strong>change colours</strong>.</p><p>Road also don&rsquo;t always stay clear (kids run into them sometimes) and traffic jams can suddenly stop traffic.  If you have to stop short, breathe, and keep both hands on the wheel </p>

title|You’re Getting Sleeeeeeeeeepy…
content|<p>Driving doesn&rsquo;t seem like it should tire you out—after all, you&rsquo;re not exactly running a marathon—but all that concentration can really tucker you out. To combat exhaustion, it&rsquo;s a good idea to:</p><ul><li>Plan your route beforehand!  Nothing will tire you out more than shouting at your SatNav while you drive in circles.</li><li>Take frequent rest stops (at least once every two hours) to think about something other than the road or have a snack.</li><li>Crack the window so you don&rsquo;t suffocate!  </li><li>If you feel tired, pull off at the next exit. Sleeping in cars is perfectly acceptable if it&rsquo;s for the sake of road safety.</li></ul>

title|Friends Aren't Always for Driving
content|<p>We&rsquo;re sure your friends are great.  But if they&rsquo;re loud or argumentative, you might want to think twice about offering them rides.  Being shouted at can&rsquo;t be good for your focus and could cause you to make mistakes.</p><p>You also might also want to set some ground rules before you offer a ride to that guy who&rsquo;s the life of the party.  Loud music and high spirits are great in a club, but in the car you should aim for a more peaceful environment. </p>

title|Other Attention Suckers
content|<p>It&rsquo;s not just other people who can be distracting, though—there are plenty of ways to take your own focus off the road.  So don&rsquo;t do them…</p><ul><li>Those furry dice hanging from your mirror might make you feel ironically cool, but when they swing around and distract you from the road, you&rsquo;ll just look lame.</li><li>As much as you feel like you can&rsquo;t bear to hear &ldquo;Call Me Maybe&rdquo; one more time, it&rsquo;s better to suffer through it than to take your eyes off the road to turn the radio and cause an accident!</li><li>Talking into a microphone is distracting—wait &lsquo;til you&rsquo;re home to take any interviews.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just looking away for a second&rdquo;, you say.  Just remember that in that second, at 60 mph (96 km/h), your car will travel 27 metres.  That&rsquo;s the same distance as running to the goal from left wing—and think about how many collisions can happen in that distance on the football pitch!</p>

title|Mobile Phones: Not A Good Driving Companion
content|<p>It&rsquo;s illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive, and for good reason: you&rsquo;re 4 times more likely to have an accident. This isn&rsquo;t just an arbitrary rule, so to avoid temptation turn off your phone while you drive.  Then, when you get to your destination or pull off the motorway for one of your rest stops, you can go respond to all your admirers with all the things you <strong>absolutely should not do while you drive</strong>:</p><ul><li>Check what hilarious voicemails your friends left from the pub last night</li><li>Make calls</li><li>Read or send a text</li></ul>

title|SatNavs: Let It Be
content|<p>SatNavs are not made to be programmed while you drive.  If you need to change something, pull off the road.  If your SatNav gets you lost, pull over or pull off onto a side road before you scold it and fuss with the map.  <strong>Don&rsquo;t try to reprogram while you drive</strong>.</p>

title|Question and Answer Time
content|<p>QUESTION: Obviously I don&rsquo;t want to fuss with my phone while I drive.  But if I&rsquo;m not using my hands, it&rsquo;s OK, right?</p><p>ANSWER: The hands are only part of the problem.  The bigger problem is that your riveting conversation about East Enders will take your mind off the road.  <strong>Hands-free phones are just as dangerous</strong> because your mind can&rsquo;t deal with two things at once—and since your friend isn&rsquo;t in the car, she doesn&rsquo;t realize that her chat is distracting you from the brake lights of the lorry in front of you.</p><p><strong>It's never safe to use a phone while you drive. Wait and find a safe place to stop.</strong></p>

content|<p>QUESTION: I get that yellow is a nice colour, but why are there yellow lines painted at intervals across the road?</p><p>ANSWER: Yellow is a nice colour, but sometimes they&rsquo;re also red.  They&rsquo;re meant to warn you about things like upcoming hazards, like roundabouts or areas with reduced speed limits.</p><p><strong>Yellow (or red) means pay extra attention to the road – because something weird will happen.</strong></p>

content|<p>QUESTION: What is a &ldquo;blind spot&rdquo;?  Is it curable?</p><p>ANSWER: Blind spots aren&rsquo;t a medical condition, so even if you have 20-20 vision it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind.  A <strong>blind spot is the area of the road that you can&rsquo;t see in your mirrors or by looking ahead.</strong>  This means you have to take extra caution when doing things like changing lanes—since it&rsquo;s possible there&rsquo;s a car just behind you that you can&rsquo;t see!</p><p>The people with the worst blind spots are lorry drivers.  If you&rsquo;re close behind, they won&rsquo;t be able to see you—so keep back!</p>
