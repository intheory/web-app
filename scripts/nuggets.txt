title|Concentration: What You Need Most To Drive
content|<p>Driving is like a video game.  Yeah, you&rsquo;ve got to concentrate on where you&rsquo;re going – and maybe your friends are being dumb and loud in the background – but you&rsquo;ve also got to <strong>concentrate </strong>on what&rsquo;s going on around you, because you never know when it will change.  Just because that guard is behind you doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not a threat, and if he comes out of nowhere, you want to be ready—so you want to be <strong>concentrating</strong>.</p>

title|Keeping an Eye on Other Drivers
content|<p>When you drive, sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to do things that might confuse other drivers.  Check first to make sure that causing them a little confusion isn&rsquo;t going to hurt anyone.  If you&rsquo;re moving off, stopping, turning and changing lanes, check up on the cars around you by:</p><ul><li>Checking in the <strong>mirrors</strong> to see who&rsquo;s behind you (and that they&rsquo;re not too close)</li><li>Double-checking before you do anything, just in case (and be careful of those pesky windscreen pillars, which can make it hard to see)</li><li><strong>USING YOUR TURN SIGNAL</strong>.  This is not like giving information to the enemy, we promise. </li><li>If you&rsquo;re reversing and can&rsquo;t see, get someone to help guide you.  Preferably someone who isn&rsquo;t an idiot and who won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s funny to send you into a lamppost.</li></ul><p>So all this checking is great in theory—but what about when parked cars are blocking your view at a junction?<br><strong>Inching forward</strong> is the best plan here, until you can see properly!</p>

title|Fun with Overtaking 
content|<p>Another potentially confusing situation is overtaking.  Beyond the potential social awkwardness (sorry mate, you&rsquo;re slow) is the real danger of having two cars in a part of the road designed for just one—so be <strong>super careful when overtaking</strong>.</p><strong><em>Your Overtaking Checklist:</em></strong><br>□ The road ahead is clear and straight and you can see what&rsquo;s going on<br>□ You have plenty of time to get all the way past<br>□ The other drivers realize you&rsquo;re there and won&rsquo;t be terrified when you pop out of nowhere

Once you start to feel like it&rsquo;s at all hard to see, <strong>turn on your lights</strong>, regardless of what the streetlights are doing.</p><p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a good idea to be loud—like when you&rsquo;re crossing a hump bridge.

content|<p>Road signs aren&rsquo;t just there for decoration (even though obviously they&rsquo;re sooo pretty)—they&rsquo;re there to give you information, especially about possible danger.  A few key rules for road signs:</p><ul><li>Well, first of all… <strong>listen to the signs.  </strong>If they stay stop, stop.  If they say yield, yield.  If they set a certain speed limit, obey it.</li><li><strong>Slow down</strong> if there are any hazards.</li><li><strong>Watch the other cars</strong>. This will help you outsmart them if they do anything strange or create a dangerous situation.</li></ul>

To combat exhaustion, it&rsquo;s a good idea to:</p><ul><li>Plan your route beforehand!  Nothing will tire you out more than shouting at your SatNav while you drive in circles.</li><li>Take frequent rest stops (at least once every two hours) to think about something other than the road or have a snack.</li><li>Crack the window so you don&rsquo;t suffocate!  </li><li>If you feel tired, pull off at the next exit. Sleeping in cars is perfectly acceptable if it&rsquo;s for the sake of road safety.</li></ul>

The bigger problem is that your riveting conversation about East Enders will take your mind off the road.  <strong>Hands-free phones are just as dangerous</strong> because your mind can&rsquo;t deal with two things at once—and since your friend isn&rsquo;t in the car, she doesn&rsquo;t realize that her chat is distracting you from the brake lights of the lorry in front of you.</p><p><strong>It's never safe to use a phone while you drive.

Is it curable?</p><p>ANSWER: Blind spots aren&rsquo;t a medical condition, so even if you have 20-20 vision it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind.  A <strong>blind spot is the area of the road that you can&rsquo;t see in your mirrors or by looking ahead.</strong>  This means you have to take extra caution when doing things like changing lanes—since it&rsquo;s possible there&rsquo;s a car just behind you that you can&rsquo;t see!</p><p>The people with the worst blind spots are lorry drivers.  If you&rsquo;re close behind, they won&rsquo;t be able to see you—so keep back!</p>

title|Road Hazards
content|<p>The hard part of driving after you&rsquo;ve learned how to drive</p><p>The first skill you&rsquo;ve got to learn when you&rsquo;re learning to drive is basic control of the car.  Obviously if you can&rsquo;t drive in a straight line, that&rsquo;s got to be there before you can do much else.  As you start to get better at the basics, though, you&rsquo;ll find that you improve in your ability to recognize hazards.</p><p>A hazard is anything that requires you to <strong>take action</strong> or change what you would have been doing. So any situation in which you&rsquo;re driving in a straight line and suddenly need to do something different counts as a hazard.</p><p>They come in a few different types:</p><ul><li><strong>Static</strong> hazards: these include roundabouts an d   j u n c t i o n s   b a s i c a l l y   a n y t h i n g   t h a t & r s q u o ; s   a l w a y s   t h e r e   ( s t a t i c )   b u t   c a n   s t i l l   c a u s e   t r o u b l e   a n d   c o n f u s i o n < / l i > < l i > < s t r o n g > M o v i n g < / s t r o n g >   h a z a r d s :   o t h e r   c a r s ,   c h i l d r e n   r u n n

content|<p>A static hazard is anything disruptive that doesn&rsquo;t move.  You also need to be the one looking out for static hazards, since they won&rsquo;t look out for you [guy honking his horn at a speed bump, shouting &ldquo;get out of the way!&rdquo;].  Static hazards can include:</p><ul><li>Features of traffic flow, such as bends, junctions, roundabouts, and traffic lights</li><li>Parked vehicles</li><li>Road obstacles such as skips in the road, roadworks, and traffic calming</li><li>Different types of crossings for pedestrians and cycles</li></ul>

title|Watching Out
content|<p>Generally a static hazard is going to require some sort of response from you, so:</p><ul><li>take a mental note of their existence, since it&rsquo;s always good to realize you&rsquo;re approaching a junction or roundabout</li><li>slow down and be ready to stop, just in case!</li></ul><p>You&rsquo;ll have a better idea of when they&rsquo;re coming if you pay attention to road signs and markings—they don&rsquo;t just put them on the road to keep sign-putter-uppers in work. Signs warn you about static hazards so that you can reduce your speed and be ready to take action if you need to.</p><p>Other warnings that are there to help you stay safe include: traffic lights, other light signals, level crossings and signals from police officers.</p>

title|Parked Cars: Unpredictably Static
content|<p>Parked cars don&rsquo;t move, so they&rsquo;re static hazards, but they&rsquo;re not quite so predictable as junctions or roundabouts, which generally stay in the same place day to day.  Parked cars can be especially troublesome in busy areas or when they&rsquo;re parked illegally (like when they&rsquo;re in a zebra crossing and cause pedestrians to try to cross in weird ways).  Parked cars also can signal these dangers:</p><ul><li>children dashing out from between the cars,</li><li>car doors opening, and</li><li>cars moving away.</li></ul><p>Make sure you&rsquo;d be able to stop!</p>

content|<p>When lanes are closed, realize that people are going to try to merge. Watch out for the car in front of you and keep an eye on everyone around you.</p><p>Take extra care on two-way roads which have a third lane in the centre, since traffic going in either direction can use this lane for overtaking.</p><p>If you are driving on a motorway or dual carriageway and see a hazard or obstruction ahead, flash your hazard warning lights to give the traffic behind you a heads-up.</p><p>In the sad event that your car breaks down and is obstructing a lane, switch on your hazard warning lights to make sure other people on the road know you&rsquo;re there.  If you&rsquo;re suddenly a static hazard, it&rsquo;s good to make sure everyone knows you&rsquo;re there!</p>

title|Reducing Congestions
content|<p><strong>Active traffic management (ATM)</strong> is something some motorways use to try to reduce slow traffic. When there&rsquo;s ATM, mandatory speed limit signs will show on the gantries. The goal is to keep traffic moving constantly and to prevent it from bunching up, and these variable speed limits can help.</p><p>In ATM areas, the hard shoulder will sometimes be used as a running lane. You&rsquo;ll know when it&rsquo;s OK to use it because there&rsquo;ll be a speed limit above it. If there&rsquo;s a red cross above the hard shoulder, this means it&rsquo;s reserved for breakdowns and such.  Emergency refuge areas should be available when the hard shoulder is open as a lane so that if you have an emergency or breakdown, you have somewhere to go.</p><p>To reduce congestion, Highways Agency traffic officers have been introduced on motorways throughout England. These officers:</p><ul><li>are able to stop and direct anyone on a motorway or an 'A' road – so listen to them</li><li>answer motorway emergency telephones in some areas, instead of these calls going to the police</l㹩⼼汵ਾ+䌀汯畯

title|Times You Can Stop on the Motorway
content|<p>Motorways are generally for driving pretty fast.  Only stop on the motorway:</p><ul> <li>if flashing red lights are showing above every lane</li> <li>if the police tell you to</li>  <li>in a traffic jam</li><li>in an emergency or breakdown.</li></ul><p>Move over if signals on the overhead gantries tell you to—they know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p><p> Only stop on the hard shoulder in an emergency. To stop for any other reason, such as to have a cheeky nap or look at a map, either leave at the next exit or go to a service area.  The shoulder isn&rsquo;t that safe, so only use it in an emergency!</p><p>If your vehicle breaks down or has a puncture, head for the hard shoulder first, and then go in search of an emergency telephone to call for help. Emergency telephones are:</p><ul><li>normally at one mile intervals, with marker posts at 100-metre intervals pointing you in the direction of the nearest phone</li><li>connected direct to police or Highways Agency control, who will come find you and sort you out!</li></ul><p>When using an emergency phone, stand and face oncoming traffic so that you&rsquo;re aware of any hazards approaching - for example, the draught from a large vehicle could unsteady you if you're not ready for it, or car horns could just be terrifying. </p> <p>If you decide to use your mobile phone to call, check your location (the number on the nearest marker post) before you make the call and tell emergency services what it is, since this will help them – you know – figure out which part of the motorway you&rsquo;ve become stranded on.</p><p> To get back onto the carriageway from the shoulder, wait for a decent-sized gap and then speed up on the hard shoulder before moving out onto the main carriageway. </p><p>If you break down and can&rsquo;t make it to the hard shoulder, switch on your hazard warning lights (per usual) and leave your vehicle only when you can get clear of the carriageway safely—since getting caught up by cars in the middle of the motorway would probably not be the high point of your day.</p>

Actually, they can even get blown over, so watch out for them in poor weather – there should be signs to warn you if the road is particularly prone to crosswinds.

It MUST NOT be used between 11.30 pm and 7.00 am. <strong>Only use your horn when stationary if another vehicle is likely to cause a danger.</strong> It&rsquo;s not a place to vent your anger about bad drivers or traffic—try reddit for that.</p><p>The only reason that you should flash your headlights is to warn other road users that you're there, not for funzies or to see the pretty lights.</p>

title|You and the Po-lice
content|<p>A police officer following you in a patrol vehicle may flash their <strong>headlights</strong> or blue lights or use their siren or horn, then indicate left and point to the left to get you to stop. Pull up on the left as soon as it's safe to do so.  You want to do what they say.</p><p>Highways Agency traffic officers will use amber flashing lights, usually from behind, and will point or indicate left to get you to pull over. These officers operate on motorways and some 'A' class roads in England only, so for once the Northern Irish are not getting the short end of the stick here.</p><p>It is an offence not to comply with directions given by police or other traffic officers, as you&rsquo;ve probably figured out from movies and TV.</p>

title|Contraflow Lanes: Don’t Go There
content|<p>Contraflow lanes flow in the opposite direction to traffic.  They&rsquo;re generally for special vehicles, like buses and cycles, and are usually found on one-way streets.  There should be signs and clear markings to warn you about this confusion. <strong>Don't enter these lanes.</strong></p><p>You may also see contraflow lanes at roadworks. When you see the signs, <strong>reduce your speed </strong>and pick an acceptable lane and stick with it.  Remember to keep back from the vehicle in front of you!</p><p>On a 3-lane motorway, the right-hand lane is for overtaking. That means you&rsquo;re not supposed to stay here post-overtake.  Always move back to a lane on your left after overtaking so that everyone gets their turn to overtake. You&rsquo;re not supposed to overtake on the left on a free-flowing motorway or dual carriageway.</p>

content|<p>Going fast might be fun, but having an incident definitely dampens that fun.  A really, really good way to try to avoid wrecks is to follow the speed limits on the road you&rsquo;re on. </p><p>When no other limit is posted, the guidelines generally are 60 mph (96 km/h) on a single carriageway road, but lower speed limits apply on other roads for vehicles towing a trailer or caravan.  These are:</p><ul><li>50 mph (80 km/h) on a single carriageway road </li><li>60 mph (96 km/h) on a dual carriageway or motorway</li></ul><p>Sometimes you might see a minimum speed limit signs—this means you should travel at this speed (or higher) unless it&rsquo;s unsafe to.</p><p>The national speed limit for cars and motorcycles on a dual carriage motorway is 70 mph (112 km/h)—and don&rsquo;t forget, this is the same for every lane!</p><p>On smaller roads, street lights generally mean there is a 30 mph (48 km/h) speed limit unless signs tell you something different.</p>

Don't drive or park in one marked by a broken line unless it's unavoidable.  Again, these are lanes for cycles, not cars.</p><p>Only drive over a footpath when you&rsquo;re accessing a property—driving on the footpath is really unadvisable, as much as video games might make it seem fun.</p><p>On a dual carriageway (even if it&rsquo;s got 3 lanes), the right lane is for overtaking—not long-term traveling.

title|Other General Tips
content|<p>Get your car checked up regularly to keep in tip-top shape—this will help the fuel economy and your exhaust emissions will be cleaner.  It has to pass an emissions test to pass the MOT test, so this is pretty important if you want to keep driving it.</p><p>Get rid of oil and batteries responsibly if you&rsquo;re working on your own car by taking them to a local authority site or a garage. Don't pour oil down the drain.  This is so so sososoos bad for the earth.</p><p>  Noise pollution is also a real thing.  In built-up areas, don't use your car horn between 11.30 pm and 7.00 am, unless you&rsquo;re actually warning about a real danger.  Definitely not a time for drunken horn honking or random fits of car-horn-anger.</p><p>Going fast a lot increases your chances of breaking down. Make sure you check your vehicle before a long motorway journey-- especially oil, water and tyre pressure.</p>

What other types of traffic calming measures might I have to deal with soon?</p><p>ANSWER: Road humps, road narrowing and chicanes are popular traffic calming measures.  These help slow the traffic down, so basically you&rsquo;re being encouraged to drive slowly.  Additionally, many narrow residential streets are getting a reduced speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h).  Keep an eye out for these signs and remember it&rsquo;s not done to annoy you—it&rsquo;s done to try to save lives!</p>

Your overall stopping distance is the distance your car travels between when you realise you need to brake to the moment the vehicle stops.  This means that both your <strong>thinking</strong> and <strong>braking</strong> influence the distance you have to stop.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to learn the typical thinking, braking and stopping distances in <em><u>The Highway Code</u></em>. They&rsquo;ll give you estimates for how long it takes to stop a car with good tyres and brakes in several conditions:</p><ul><li>on a dry road</li><li>in good conditions.</li></ul><p>Don't just learn the figures - you need to be able to make these judgments on your own while you drive or they won&rsquo;t do you any good!

title|Wet Conditions
content|<p>In wet conditions, give yourself PLENTY of room, especially if someone overtakes you or cuts you off.  Stopping is hard in the rain!!</p><p>Aquaplaning is a danger you might encounter in heavy rain. Basically, what it means is that the tyres lift off the road surface and skate on a film of water. This might sound fun but it&rsquo;s <strong>really really </strong>bad. The steering becomes light and you lose control of your car—definitely less than ideal.  On ice, the tyres make hardly any noise. If this happens to you:</p><ul> <li>ease off the accelerator (not that you&rsquo;d want to go any faster at this point anyways)</li><li><strong>don't brake</strong> until your steering goes back to normal.</li></ul><p>If you've driven through deep water, such as a ford or a flood, you should really give your brakes a bit of a test. You might need to dry them out by pressing lightly on the brake pedal as you drive along.  This will help keep you out of any sticky (or slippery, really) situations.</p>

content|<p>Ironically, hot weather can also pose a danger. The road surface can become soft which means your tyres might not grip as well. Not being able to grip the road affects your ability to brake and steer, which is obviously bad news.</p><p>The sun really isn&rsquo;t always your friend while you&rsquo;re driving: bright sunlight can dazzle. You might want to use arm signals just in case other people are dazzled by the sun and can&rsquo;t see your indicators.  (Of course, then they might just be dazzled by you ;) )</p>

title|Skidding

title|Preventing Skidding
content|<p>Here&rsquo;s one thing you can definitely prevent though: skidding is usually caused by the <strong>driver, not the weather</strong>. As a driver, you need to adjust to the road, weather and traffic conditions.</p><p>Obviously, weather does factor into this (skidding on sunshine isn&rsquo;t really a thing).  There's way more risk of skidding in wet or icy conditions. Black ice is super dangerous since you don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s there until you feel the steering becoming light.  So be super careful for this secret ice if it&rsquo;s wet and below freezing.</p><p>You can reduce your risk of skidding and wheelspin by lowering your speed and driving in as high a gear as possible.  Keep an eye out for road signs and markings so that you won&rsquo;t be taken unawares. You can then be a graceful and elegant driver who doesn&rsquo;t skid by:</p><ul><li>slowing down gradually before you reach a hazard (like a bend) instead of jolting to a stop</li> <li>avoiding sudden steering movements. </li></ul>

title|Don't Panic!

title|Anti-lock Braking Systems
content|<p>Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) reduce the risk of skidding if you do have to brake suddenly (like say if there&rsquo;s an emergency). This clever gadget can anticipate based on wheel speeds whether you might be about to lock up. </p><p>If you're driving a vehicle with ABS and you start skidding:</p><ul><li>press the footbrake rapidly and firmly</li><li>don't release the brake pedal until you have stopped.</li></ul><p>Although your stopping distance might not be any shorter, you should at least be able to steer in the meantime because your wheels won&rsquo;t lock. However, it&rsquo;s not perfect, and it may not work as effectively where there's:</p><ul><li>surface water</li><li>a loose road surface.</li></ul>

content|<p>When fogs &ldquo;seriously reduce&rsquo; visibility, use your headlights or even fog lights if you have them. 'Seriously reduced' generally means if you can't see for more than 100 metres (328 feet).</p><p>ONLY use your fog lights if visibility is seriously reduced, and turn them off as soon as it&rsquo;s safe to. Don't use fog lights when you don&rsquo;t really need them because:</p><ul> <li>you can get in trouble with the law</li> <li>they can dazzle/confuse other drivers</li><li>you can make it hard for other drivers to tell when you are/are not braking, which is obviously a bit dangerous!</li></ul><p>Drive a bit slowly when it&rsquo;s foggy since it&rsquo;s hard to see what&rsquo;s happening ahead. Give yourself some extra distance from the car in front of you and allow yourself plenty of time – rushing around in fog will probably not work out in your favour.</p><p>Driving on motorways in fog is especially tricky.

Coasting is really not a great idea because it reduces your control of really important things like &ldquo;steering&rdquo; and &ldquo;braking&rdquo;.

If you don&rsquo;t have anti-lock brakes and your vehicle starts to skid while you&rsquo;re trying to brake on a wet road, you&rsquo;ve got to release the footbrake.

content|<p>QUESTION: I've been following a slow-moving vehicle for for-ev-er. I seriously want to overtake it but it&rsquo;s had it&rsquo;s right signal on for a while.  Can I try?</p><p>ANSWER: You don&rsquo;t want to assume this guy forgot to turn off his signal. If he&rsquo;s going slow especially, he might just be looking for something and will turn off suddenly.  You should keep back until he either turns or cancels his signal.</p>

title|Caravans
content|<p>Never, ever, ever, ever, ever is it a good idea for a person to travel in a caravan while it&rsquo;s being towed. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re planning to drag a caravan around, it&rsquo;s a great idea to get a stabilizer fitted to your towbar so that your vehicle stays a bit easier to handle. You&rsquo;ll especially appreciate this when you&rsquo;re driving in crosswinds.  Another good-idea safety device is a breakaway cable, if you get a chance to get one of these.</p><p>If your trailer or caravan starts to swerve while you&rsquo;re driving, chill down with the accelerator and slow the heck down so that you regain control.</p><p>If you choose to take a caravan along, you&rsquo;ll unfortunately have to follow stricter rules.  On a three-lane motorway, towing vehicles have to:</p><ul><li>keep a 60 mph (96 km/h) speed limit</li><li>stay in the left-hand and centre lanes only –  no caravans allowed in the right lane</li></ul>

title|Children & Schools
content|<p><strong>Children</strong>, as you probably know, can be totally mental and don&rsquo;t always behave like adults.  This is especially a concern because they might not look before running into the road. </p><p> Be <strong>EXTRA CAREFUL</strong> when there are <strong>children</strong> around – like especially when you&rsquo;re driving near a <strong>school</strong>.</p><p>There may be flashing amber lights under school warning signs to alert you to the possible child-dangers running around.  Reduce your speed while you&rsquo;re in these areas so that you are totally on-guard and won&rsquo;t flatten any little ones.</p><p>School crossing patrol might stop traffic by stepping into the road with a stop sign.  You&rsquo;ve got to be ready for this.</p><p> <strong>Don&rsquo;t idle</strong> or park on the yellow zigzag lines near schools, since lots of people need a clear view of these crossing areas, such as drivers on the road and pedestrians on the pavement.  Messing with the ability of little kids to cross the street will not make you popular, so just be as cautious as you possibly can be.</p><p> <strong>Buses</strong> and coaches that carry <strong>schoolchildren</strong> should have special signs at the back to let you know <strong>THIS IS NOT A NORMAL BUS</strong>.  This is especially important because it might stop places where you wouldn&rsquo;t expect a bus to stop (i.e. not bus stops).</p>

title|Elderly & Disabled Pedestrians
content|<p>If you see older people starting to cross the road, just be careful since they might have misjudged how fast you were coming or how long it would take them to cross the road.  If you end up waiting for an elderly person to finish crossing, just be nice and patient—they could be someone&rsquo;s grandma.</p><p>Treat disabled pedestrians just like other pedestrians, but just be patient since they might take a bit longer to cross.  A pedestrian with hearing difficulties might be walking with a dog with a distinctive yellow or burgundy coloured coat or distinctive orange lead and collar.  A person carrying a white stick with a red band, or walking with a dog wearing a red and white check harness, is both deaf and blind.  Obviously be careful, since they have had less of a chance to realize that a vehicle is coming towards them.</p>

Look out for signs in this section and make sure that you are not a bridge basher. All bridges with a clearance of less than 16 feet 6 inches (about 5 metres) are normally signed. Both regulatory roundels and warning triangles can be used, depending on the type of bridge.

Where the traffic-calmed area is reached by turning into a side road, the sign will include an arrow. Traffic calming is the term used to describe physical features provided along a road to encourage drivers to reduce speed. These features are introduced for the safety of all road users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic calming schemes can employ a variety of measures, including road humps and narrowings. Warning signs often indicate the type of measure to be expected. There may be an entry sign at the boundary of an area that has traffic calming features.

This is known as “Active Traffic Management”.

content|Hard shoulders: At intermediate junctions, the hard shoulder becomes the exit lane leading directly to the slip road. A sign indicates where this change of use takes place. If the hard shoulder is not already in use as a traffic lane, you can move across to leave the motorway when you have passed the sign. When the hard shoulder is in use as a traffic lane, it should normally be used only by traffic leaving at the next junction, as it becomes a lane drop at the junction (i.e. the lane becomes the exit slip road).

content|The zig‑zag markings at crossings are there to ensure that drivers and pedestrians can see each other clearly. As a driver, you must not park your vehicle anywhere within these markings (before or after the crossing). Also, you must not overtake a moving motor vehicle within the zig-zag area before the crossing, nor must you overtake a vehicle that has stopped next to the crossing either to obey signals or because pedestrians are using a Zebra crossing. If you are in a queue of vehicles that extends over a crossing, you should keep the crossing clear and look out for pedestrians who might be in the road. As a pedestrian, for your own safety, do not cross the road within the area marked by the zig‑zags: keep to the crossing. Crossings for cyclists or horse riders also have zig‑zag markings, and the above rules apply to these also.

content|Pedestrians should never cross the road within the zig‑zag area. Drivers should stop at the broken “give way” line (about 1 metre before the crossing) when pedestrians are using the crossing. Some crossings may be close to junctions where queuing takes place (e.g. at a roundabout). Drivers should not queue over the crossing and should take extra care when moving off, keeping a lookout for pedestrians. If there are two traffic lanes, but only one has a queue that extends over the crossing, drivers in the free‑flowing lane should proceed with care and be prepared to stop, as pedestrians on the crossing may be obscured by stationary vehicles. You must not overtake a vehicle that has stopped at the “give way” line to allow pedestrians to cross.

All lanes on the carriageway will be closed, but traffic will move slowly forward, over a distance of several miles, on the approach to the area where the work is being undertaken. By the time the convoy reaches this area, the works should have been completed, traffic will be allowed to increase its speed and traffic lanes will be opened.

content|Where a mandatory speed limit is imposed at a road works site, advance warning may be given, especially on motorways and high-speed dual carriageway roads. However, this sign is less likely to be used in the future: the first speed limit sign will be located at the point where the speed limit commences

content|The end of a temporary mandatory speed limit is indicated by the “end of road works” sign. However, the message may be reinforced by a sign indicating the permanent speed limit beyond the road works. This may be combined with the “end of road works” sign. Where the permanent limit after the works is different from that in advance of the works, a speed limit sign is always used. The national speed limit sign shown in the example is varied to the appropriate limit

The sign is usually supplemented by a “C” symbol road marking. Direction signs may incorporate the “C” symbol to indicate routes that lead into the charging zone.

content|In some town and city centres, certain streets may be closed for part of the day, either to all traffic (e.g. pedestrian zones) or to through traffic, with access permitted, for example, to public transport. Enforcement of these restrictions may be by the use of automatic bollards that rise from the ground to provide a physical closure. Where such bollards are in use, warning signs are normally provided.

content|Driver location signs: These have been introduced at regular intervals along many motorways and some other roads so that, in the event of a vehicle breakdown or other emergency, the exact location can be identified quickly. They show the motorway or road number, the carriageway identifier and a distance reference.

content|Some signs are designed to provide information about varying traffic conditions, such as delays or diversions ahead, or to warn of specific hazards, such as animals or debris in the road. These are called “variable message signs” and may be free-standing with an electronic display, such as the signs that have been erected above motorway hard shoulders.
