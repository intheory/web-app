To assess how your actions will affect following traffic
Because you will need to brake sharply to a stop
To check what is happening on the road ahead
extract
You should be constantly scanning the road for clues about what is going to happen next. Check your mirrors regularly, particularly as soon as you spot a hazard. What is happening behind may affect your response to hazards ahead.

options
An area covered by your right-hand mirror
An area not covered by your headlights
An area covered by your left-hand mirror
An area not covered by your mirrors
extract
Modern vehicles provide the driver with well-positioned mirrors which are essential to safe driving. However, they cannot see every angle of the scene behind and to the sides of the vehicle. This is why it is essential that you check over your shoulder, so that you are aware of any hazards not reflected in your mirrors.
image
no 
question
Using a hands-free phone is likely to
options
improve your safety
increase your concentration
reduce your view
divert your attention
extract
Unlike someone in the car with you, the person on the other end of the line is unable to see the traffic situations you are dealing with. They will not stop speaking to you even if you are approaching a hazardous situation. You need to be concentrating on your driving all of the time, but especially so when dealing with a hazard.
image
no
question
Your vehicle is fitted with a hands-free phone system. Using this equipment whilst driving
options
is quite safe as long as you slow down
could distract your attention from the road
is recommended by The Highway Code
could be very good for road safety

options
reduce your speed to 30 mph
pull up on the hard shoulder
move into the left-hand lane
stop in a safe place
extract
When driving on motorways, you can’t just pull up to answer your mobile phone. Do not stop on the hard shoulder or slip road. To avoid being distracted it’s safer to switch it off when driving.

You are turning right onto a dual carriageway. What should you do before emerging?
options
Stop, apply the handbrake and then select a low gear
Position your vehicle well to the left of the side road
Check that the central reservation is wide enough for your vehicle
Make sure that you leave enough room for a vehicle behind
extract
Before emerging right onto a dual carriageway make sure that the central reserve is deep enough to protect your vehicle.

Neglecting to do this could place part or all of your vehicle in the path of approaching traffic and cause a collision.
image
no
question
When emerging from junctions, which is most likely to obstruct your view?

options
stop and wait for the green light
stop and wait for the red light
give way to pedestrians waiting to cross
give way to pedestrians already on the crossing
extract
Pelican crossings are signal-controlled crossings operated by pedestrians. Pushbutton controls change the signals. Pelican crossings have no red-and-amber stage before green.

reversing into a parking space
following another vehicle too closely
driving with rear fog lights on

options
before restarting the engine after it has stalled
to keep a safe gap from the vehicle in front
before using the ‘Mirror-Signal- Manoeuvre’ routine
when emerging on wet roads
extract
To measure this, choose a fixed reference point such as a bridge, sign or tree. When the vehicle ahead passes the object, say to yourself ‘Only a fool breaks the twosecond rule.’ If you reach the object before you finish saying this, you’re TOO CLOSE.

question
When overtaking a horse and rider you should
options
sound your horn as a warning
go past as quickly as possible
flash your headlights as a warning
go past slowly and carefully
extract
Horses can become startled by the sound of a car engine or the rush of air caused by passing too closely. Keep well back and only pass when it is safe; leave them plenty of room. You may have to use the other side of the road to go past: if you do, first make sure there is no oncoming traffic.

Swerve past it and sound your horn
Flash your headlights and drive up close behind
Slow down and be ready to stop

Where you can see pedestrians waiting to cross, slow down and prepare to stop.

options
Be patient and wait

options
give you a good view of the road ahead
stop following traffic from rushing through the junction

question
You are approaching a red light at a puffin crossing. Pedestrians are on the crossing. The red light will stay on until
options
you start to edge forward on to the crossing
the pedestrians have reached a safe position
the pedestrians are clear of the front of your vehicle
a driver from the opposite direction reaches the crossing
extract
The electronic device will automatically detect that the pedestrians have reached a safe position. Don’t proceed until the green light shows it is safe for vehicles to do so.

options
Flashing amber
Red

question
You are driving a slow-moving vehicle on a narrow winding road. You should
options
keep well out to stop vehicles overtaking dangerously
wave following vehicles past you if you think they can overtake quickly
pull in safely when you can, to let following vehicles overtake
give a left signal when it is safe for vehicles to overtake you
extract
Try not to hold up a queue of traffic. Other road users may become impatient and this could lead to reckless actions. If you’re driving a slow-moving vehicle and the road is narrow, look for a safe place to pull in. DON’T wave other traffic past since this could be dangerous if you or they haven’t seen an oncoming vehicle.

You have a loose filler cap on your diesel fuel tank. This will
options
waste fuel and money
make roads slippery for other road users
improve your vehicles’ fuel consumption
increase the level of exhaust emissions

Diesel fuel is especially slippery if spilled on a wet road. At the end of a dry spell of weather you should be aware that the road surfaces may have a high level of diesel spillage that hasn’t been washed away by rain.
image
no
question
To avoid spillage after refuelling, you should make sure that
options
your tank is only three quarters full
you have used a locking filler cap
you check your fuel gauge is working
your filler cap is securely fastened
extract
When learning to drive it is a good idea to practise filling your car with fuel. Ask your instructor if you can use a petrol station and fill the fuel tank yourself. You need to know where the filler cap is located on the car you are driving in order to park on the correct side of the pump. Take care not to overfill the tank or spill fuel. Make sure you secure the filler cap as soon as you have replaced the fuel nozzle.

Young, inexperienced and newly qualified drivers can often be involved in crashes. This is due to
options
being too cautious at junctions
driving in the middle of their lane
