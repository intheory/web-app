It can be frustrating and worrying to find your planned route is blocked by roadworks or diversions. If you have planned an alternative you will feel less stressed and more able to concentrate fully on your driving or riding. If your original route is mostly on motorways it\D5s a good idea to plan an alternative using nonmotorway roads. Always carry a map with you just in case you need to refer to it.

Missing out some gears helps to reduce the amount of time you are accelerating and this saves fuel. You don\D5t always need to change up or down through each gear. As you accelerate between each gear more fuel is injected into the engine than if you had maintained constant acceleration. Fewer gear changes means less fuel used.

Overall stopping distance is made up of thinking and braking distance. You are on a good, dry road surface with good brakes and tyres. What is the typical BRAKING distance from 50 mph?

Be aware this is just the braking distance. You need to add the thinking distance to this to give the OVERALL STOPPING DISTANCE. At 50 mph the typical thinking distance will be 15 metres (50 feet), plus a braking distance of 38 metres (125 feet), giving an overall stopping distance of 53 metres (175 feet).

answers

extract
If an anti-lock braking system is fitted it activates automatically when maximum braking pressure is applied or when it senses that the wheels are about to lock. It prevents the wheels from locking so you can continue to steer the vehicle during braking. It does not remove the need for good driving practices such as anticipation and correct speed for the conditions.

Preventing the wheels from locking means that the vehicle\D5s steering and stability can be maintained, leading to safer stopping.  However, you must ensure that the engine does not stall, as this could disable the power steering. Look in your vehicle handbook for the correct method when stopping in an emergency.

answers

extract
When stopping in an emergency anti-lock brakes will help you continue to steer when braking. In poor weather conditions this may be less effective. You need to depress the clutch pedal to prevent the car stalling as most power steering systems use an engine-driven pump and will only operate when the engine is running. Look in your vehicle handbook for the correct method when stopping in an emergency.

options

answers
2,3
extract
In very wet weather water can build up between the tyre and the road surface. As a result your vehicle actually rides on a thin film of water and your tyres will not grip the road. Gravel or shingle surfaces also offer less grip and can present problems when braking. An anti-lock braking system may be ineffective in these conditions.

Coasting, is the term used when the clutch is held down, or the gear lever is in neutral, and the vehicle is allowed to free wheel.  This reduces the driver\D5s control of the  vehicle. When you coast, the engine can\D5t drive the wheels to pull you through a corner. Coasting also removes the assistance of engine braking that helps to slow the car.

Others can go on the road as well and have a speed limit of 8 mph (12 km/h). They are now very common and are generally used by the elderly,disabled or infirm. Take great care as they are extremely vulnerable because of their low speed and small size.

If your rear fog lights are left on when it isn\D5t foggy,the glare they cause makes it difficult for road users behind to know whether you are braking or you have just forgotten to turn off your rear fog lights.This can be a particular problem on wet roads and on motorways. If you leave yourrear fog lights on at night, road users behind you are likely to be dazzled and this could put them at risk.

If the skid has been caused by braking too hard for the conditions,release the brake.You may then need to reapply and release the brake again.You may need to do this a number of times.This will allow the wheels to turn and so limit the skid.Skids are much easier to get into than they are to get out of.Prevention is better than cure.Stay alert to the road and weather conditions.Drive so that you can stop within the distance you can see to be clear.
