question
You are following other vehicles in fog. You have your lights on. What else can you do to reduce the chances of being in a collision?
options
Keep close to the vehicle in front
Use your main beam instead of dipped headlights
Keep up with the faster vehicles
Reduce your speed and increase the gap in front
answers
4
extract
When it’s foggy use dipped headlights. This will help you see and be seen by other road users. If visibility is seriously reduced consider using front and rear fog lights. Keep a sensible speed and don’t follow the vehicle in front too closely. If the road is wet and slippery you’ll need to allow twice the normal stopping distance.

question
You are driving on an icy road. How can you avoid wheelspin?
options
Drive at a slow speed in as high a gear as possible
Use the handbrake if the wheels start to slip
Brake gently and repeatedly
Drive in a low gear at all times
answers
1
extract
If you’re travelling on an icy road extra caution will be required to avoid loss of control. Keeping your speed down and using the highest gear possible will reduce the risk of the tyres losing their grip on this slippery surface.

question
You are driving in freezing conditions. What should you do when approaching a sharp bend? (Mark TWO)
options
Slow down before you reach the bend
Gently apply your handbrake
Coast into the bend
Avoid sudden steering movements
answers
1,4
extract
Harsh use of the accelerator, brakes or steering are likely to lead to skidding, especially on slippery surfaces. Avoid steering and braking at the same time. In icy conditions it’s very important that you constantly assess what’s ahead, so that you can take appropriate action in plenty of time.

question
You are trying to move off on snow. You should use
options
The lowest gear you can
The highest gear you can
A high engine speed
The handbrake and footbrake together
answers
2
extract
If you attempt to move off in a low gear, such as first, the engine will rev at a higher speed. This could cause the wheels to spin and dig further into the snow.

The roads are icy. You should drive slowly
options
In the highest gear possible
In the lowest gear possible With the handbrake partly on 
With your left foot on the brake
answers

How can you tell if you are driving on ice?
options
The tyres make a rumbling noise 
The tyres make hardly any noise  The steering becomes heavier
The steering becomes lighter
answers

Your overall stopping distance will be much longer when driving
options
In the rain 
In fog 
At night 
In strong winds
answers

options
It is easier to brake
The noise from your tyres sounds louder 
You will see tyre tracks on the road 
Your steering feels light
answers

extract
Don’t venture out if your journey is not necessary. If you have to travel and someone is expecting you at the other end, let them know that you will be taking longer than usual for your journey. This will stop them worrying if you don’t turn up on time and will also take the pressure off you, so you don’t feel you have to rush.

options
Doubled
Halved
Up to ten times greater 
No different
answers

As well as visibility being reduced, the road will be extremely wet. This will reduce the grip the tyres have on the road and increase the distance it takes to stop. Double your separation distance.
