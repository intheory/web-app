Overall stopping distance is made up of thinking and braking distance. You are on a good, dry road surface with good brakes and tyres. What is the typical BRAKING distance from 50 mph?
options
14 metres (46 feet)
24 metres (80 feet)
38 metres (125 feet)
55 metres (180 feet)
extract
Be aware this is just the braking distance. You need to add the thinking distance to this to give the OVERALL STOPPING DISTANCE. At 50 mph the typical thinking distance will be 15 metres (50 feet), plus a braking distance of 38 metres (125 feet), giving an overall stopping distance of 53 metres (175 feet). The distance could be greater than this depending on your attention and response to any hazards. These figures are a general guide.

question
You are turning left on a slippery road. The back of your vehicle slides to the right. You should
options
brake firmly and not turn the steering wheel
steer carefully to the left
steer carefully to the right
brake firmly and steer to the left
extract
Steer into the skid but be careful not to overcorrect with too much steering. Too much movement may lead to a skid in the opposite direction. Skids don’t just happen, they are caused. The three important factors in order are, the driver, the vehicle and the road conditions.

no
question
You are trying to move off on snow. You should use
options
the lowest gear you can
the highest gear you can
a high engine speed
the handbrake and footbrake together
extract
If you attempt to move off in a low gear, such as first, the engine will rev at a higher speed. This could cause the wheels to spin and dig further into the snow.
image
no
question
Before starting a journey in freezing weather you should clear ice and snow from your vehicle’s
options
aerial
windows
bumper
lights
mirrors
number plates
extract
Don’t travel unless you have no choice. Making unnecessary journeys in bad weather can increase the risk of having a collision. It’s important that you can see and be seen. Make sure any snow or ice is cleared from lights, mirrors, number plates and windows.
image
no
question
When driving in falling snow you should
options
brake firmly and quickly
be ready to steer sharply
use sidelights only
brake gently in plenty of time
extract
Braking on snow can be extremely dangerous. Be gentle with both the accelerator and brake to prevent wheelspin.

no
question
The MAIN benefit of having four-wheel drive is to improve
options
road holding
fuel consumption
stopping distances
passenger comfort
extract
By driving all four wheels there is improved grip, but this does not replace the skills you need to drive safely. The extra grip helps road holding when travelling on slippery or uneven roads.
image
no
question
You wish to park facing DOWNHILL. Which TWO of the following should you do?
options
Turn the steering wheel towards the kerb
Park close to the bumper of another car
Park with two wheels on the kerb
Put the handbrake on firmly
Turn the steering wheel away from the kerb
extract
Turning the wheels towards the kerb will allow it to act as a chock, preventing any forward movement of the vehicle. It will also help to leave it in gear, or select Park if you have an automatic.
image
no
question
You are about to go down a steep hill. To control the speed of your vehicle you should
options
select a high gear and use the brakes carefully
select a high gear and use the brakes firmly
select a low gear and use the brakes carefully
select a low gear and avoid using the brakes
extract
When going down a steep hill your vehicle will speed up. This will make it more difficult for you to stop. Select a lower gear to give you more engine braking and control. Use this in combination with careful use of the brakes.
image
no
question
You are driving in a built-up area. You approach a speed hump. You should
options
move across to the left-hand side of the road
wait for any pedestrians to cross
slow your vehicle right down
stop and check both pavements
extract
Many towns have speed humps to slow down traffic. Slow down when driving over them. If you go too fast they may affect your steering and suspension, causing you to lose control or even damaging it. Be aware of pedestrians in these areas
image
yes
question
You are on a long, downhill slope. What should you do to help control the speed of your vehicle?
options
Select neutral
Select a lower gear
Grip the handbrake firmly
Apply the parking brake gently
extract
Selecting a low gear when travelling downhill will help you to control your speed. The engine will assist the brakes and help prevent your vehicle gathering speed.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes reduce the chances of a skid occurring particularly when
options
driving down steep hills
braking during normal driving
braking in an emergency
driving on good road surfaces
extract
The anti-lock braking system will operate when the brakes have been applied harshly. It will reduce the chances of your car skidding, but it is not a miracle cure for careless driving.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes prevent wheels from locking. This means the tyres are less likely to
options
aquaplane
skid
puncture
wear
extract
If an anti-lock braking system is fitted it activates automatically when maximum braking pressure is applied or when it senses that the wheels are about to lock. It prevents the wheels from locking so you can continue to steer the vehicle during braking. It does not remove the need for good driving practices such as anticipation and correct speed for the conditions.
image
no
question
Vehicles fitted with anti-lock brakes
options
are impossible to skid
can be steered while you are braking
accelerate much faster
are not fitted with a handbrake
extract
Preventing the wheels from locking means that the vehicle’s steering and stability can be maintained, leading to safer stopping. However, you must ensure that the engine does not stall, as this could disable the power steering. Look in your vehicle handbook for the correct method when stopping in an emergency.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes may not work as effectively if the road surface is
options
dry
loose
wet
good
firm
extract
Poor contact with the road surface could cause one or more of the tyres to lose grip on the road. This is more likely to happen when braking in poor weather conditions, when the road surface is uneven or has loose chippings.
image
no
question
Driving a vehicle fitted with anti-lock brakes allows you to
options
brake harder because it is impossible to skid
drive at higher speeds
steer and brake at the same time
pay less attention to the road ahead
extract
When stopping in an emergency anti-lock brakes will help you continue to steer when braking. In poor weather conditions this may be less effective. You need to depress the clutch pedal to prevent the car stalling as most power steering systems use an engine-driven pump and will only operate when the engine is running. Look in your vehicle handbook for the correct method when stopping in an emergency.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes are of most use when you are
options
braking gently
driving on worn tyres
braking excessively
driving normally
extract
Anti-lock brakes will not be required when braking normally. Looking well down the road and anticipating possible hazards could prevent you having to brake late and harshly. Knowing that you have anti-lock brakes is not an excuse to drive in a careless or reckless way.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes can greatly assist with
options
a higher cruising speed
steering control when braking
control when accelerating
motorway driving
extract
If the wheels of your vehicle lock they will not grip the road and you will lose steering control. In good conditions the anti-lock system will prevent the wheels locking and allow you to retain steering control.
image
no
question
You are driving a vehicle fitted with anti-lock brakes. You need to stop in an emergency. You should apply the footbrake
options
slowly and gently
slowly but firmly
rapidly and gently
rapidly and firmly
extract
Look well ahead down the road as you drive and give yourself time and space to react safely to any hazards. You may have to stop in an emergency due to a misjudgement by another driver or a hazard arising suddenly such as a child running out into the road. In this case, if your vehicle has anti-lock brakes, you should apply the brakes immediately and keep them firmly applied until you stop.
image
no
question
You are driving along a country road. You see this sign. AFTER dealing safely with the hazard you should always
options
check your tyre pressures
switch on your hazard warning lights
accelerate briskly
test your brakes
extract
Deep water can affect your brakes, so you should check that they’re working properly before you build up speed again. Before you do this, remember to check your mirrors and consider what’s behind you
image
yes
question
Your vehicle has anti-lock brakes, but they may not always prevent skidding. This is most likely to happen when driving
options
in foggy conditions
on surface water
on loose road surfaces
on dry tarmac
at night on unlit roads
extract
In very wet weather water can build up between the tyre and the road surface. As a result your vehicle actually rides on a thin film of water and your tyres will not grip the road. Gravel or shingle surfaces also offer less grip and can present problems when braking. An anti-lock braking system may be ineffective in these conditions.
image
no
question
You are driving in heavy rain. Your steering suddenly becomes very light. You should
options
steer towards the side of the road
apply gentle acceleration
brake firmly to reduce speed
ease off the accelerator
extract
If the steering becomes light in these conditions it is probably due to a film of water that has built up between your tyres and the road surface. Easing off the accelerator should allow your tyres to displace the film of water and they should then regain their grip on the road.
image
no
question
The roads are icy. You should drive slowly
options
in the highest gear possible
in the lowest gear possible
with the handbrake partly on
with your left foot on the brake
extract
Driving at a slow speed in a high gear will reduce the likelihood of wheel-spin and help your vehicle maintain the best possible grip.
image
no
question
How can you tell if you are driving on ice?
options
The tyres make a rumbling noise
The tyres make hardly any noise
The steering becomes heavier
The steering becomes lighter
extract
Drive extremely carefully when the roads are icy. When travelling on ice, tyres make virtually no noise and the steering feels unresponsive. In icy conditions, avoid harsh braking, acceleration and steering.
image
no
question
You are driving along a wet road. How can you tell if your vehicle is aquaplaning?
options
The engine will stall
The engine noise will increase
The steering will feel very heavy
The steering will feel very light
extract
If you drive at speed in very wet conditions your steering may suddenly feel ‘light’. This means that the tyres have lifted off the surface of the road and are skating on the surface of the water. This is known as aquaplaning. Reduce speed by easing off the accelerator, but don’t brake until your steering returns to normal.
image
no
question
You are driving along a wet road. How can you tell if your vehicle’s tyres are losing their grip on the surface?
options
The engine will stall
The steering will feel very heavy
The engine noise will increase
The steering will feel very light
extract
If you drive at speed in very wet conditions your steering may suddenly feel lighter than usual. This means that the tyres have lifted off the surface of the road and are skating on the surface of the water. This is known as aquaplaning. Reduce speed but don’t brake until your steering returns to a normal feel.
image
no
question
Your overall stopping distance will be much longer when driving
options
in the rain
in fog
at night
in strong winds
extract
Extra care should be taken in wet weather as, on wet roads, your stopping distance could be double that necessary for dry conditions.
image
no
question
You are on a fast, open road in good conditions. For safety, the distance between you and the vehicle in front should be
options
a two-second time gap
one car length
2 metres (6 feet 6 inches)
two car lengths
extract
One useful method of checking that you’ve allowed enough room between you and the vehicle in front is the two-second rule. To check for a two-second time gap, choose a stationary object ahead, such as a bridge or road sign. When the car in front passes the object say 'Only a fool breaks the two-second rule'. If you reach the object before you finish saying it you're too close.
image
yes
question
You have driven through a flood. What is the first thing you should do?
options
Stop and check the tyres
Stop and dry the brakes
Check your exhaust
Test your brakes
extract
Before you test your brakes you must check for following traffic. If it is safe, gently apply the brakes to clear any water that may be covering the braking surfaces.
image
no
question
How can you use your vehicle’s engine as a brake?
options
By changing to a lower gear
By selecting reverse gear
By changing to a higher gear
By selecting neutral gear
extract
When driving on downhill stretches of road selecting a lower gear gives increased engine braking. This will prevent excess use of the brakes, which become less effective if they overheat.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes are most effective when you
options
keep pumping the foot brake to prevent skidding
brake normally, but grip the steering wheel tightly
brake promptly and firmly until you have slowed down
apply the handbrake to reduce the stopping distance
extract
Releasing the brake before you have slowed right down will disable the system. If you have to brake in an emergency ensure that you keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal until the vehicle has stopped.
image
no
question
When would an anti-lock braking system start to work?
options
After the parking brake has been applied
Whenever pressure on the brake pedal is applied
Just as the wheels are about to lock
When the normal braking system fails to operate
extract
The anti-lock braking system has sensors that detect when the wheels are about to lock. It releases the brakes momentarily to allow the wheels to revolve and grip, then automatically reapplies them. This cycle is repeated several times a second to maximise braking performance.
image
no
question
Your car is fitted with anti-lock brakes. You need to stop in an emergency. You should
options
brake normally and avoid turning the steering wheel
press the brake pedal promptly and firmly until you have stopped
keep pushing and releasing the foot brake quickly to prevent skidding
apply the handbrake to reduce the stopping distance
extract
Keep pressure on the brake pedal until you have come to a stop. The anti-lock mechanism will activate automatically if it senses the wheels are about to lock.
image
no
question
Anti-lock brakes will take effect when
options
you do not brake quickly enough
maximum brake pressure has been applied
you have not seen a hazard ahead
speeding on slippery road surfaces
extract
If your car is fitted with anti-lock brakes they will take effect when you use them very firmly in an emergency. The system will only activate when it senses the wheels are about to lock.
image
no
question
You are on a wet motorway with surface spray. You should use
options
hazard flashers
dipped headlights
rear fog lights
sidelights
extract
When surface spray reduces visibility switch on your dipped headlights. This will help other road users to see you.
image
no
question
Travelling for long distances in neutral (known as coasting)
options
improves the driver’s control
makes steering easier
reduces the driver’s control
uses more fuel
extract
Coasting, is the term used when the clutch is held down, or the gear lever is in neutral, and the vehicle is allowed to freewheel. This reduces the driver’s control of the vehicle. When you coast, the engine can’t drive the wheels to pull you through a corner. Coasting also removes theassistance of engine braking that helps to slow the car.
image
no
question
Your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock brakes. To stop quickly in an emergency you should
options
brake firmly and pump the brake pedal on and off
brake rapidly and firmly without releasing the brake pedal
brake gently and pump the brake pedal on and off
brake rapidly once, and immediately release the brake pedal
extract
Once you have applied the brake keep your foot firmly on the pedal. Releasing the brake and reapplying it will disable the antilock brake system.
image
no
question
How can you tell when you are driving over black ice?
options
It is easier to brake
The noise from your tyres sounds louder
You will see tyre tracks on the road
Your steering feels light
extract
Sometimes you may not be able to see that the road is icy. Black ice makes a road look damp. The signs that you’re travelling on black ice can be that<ul><li>the steering feels light</li><li>the noise from your tyres suddenly goes quiet.</li></ul>
image
no
question
When driving in fog, which THREE of these are correct?
options
Use dipped headlights
Position close to the centre line
Allow more time for your journey
Keep close to the car in front
Slow down
Use side lights only
extract
Don’t venture out if your journey is not necessary. If you have to travel and someone is expecting you at the other end, let them know that you will be taking longer than usual for your journey. This will stop them worrying if you don’t turn up on time and will also take the pressure off you, so you don’t feel you have to rush.

yes
question
What should the driver of the car approaching the crossing do?
options
Continue at the same speed
Sound the horn
Drive through quickly
Slow down and get ready to stop
extract
Look well ahead to see if any hazards are developing. This will give you more time to deal with them in the correct way. The man in the picture is clearly intending to cross the road. You should be travelling at a speed that allows you to check your mirror, slow down and stop in good time. You shouldn’t have to brake harshly.
image
yes
question
You see this sign ahead. You should expect the road to
options
go steeply uphill
go steeply downhill
bend sharply to the left
bend sharply to the right
extract
Adjust your speed in good time and select the correct gear for your speed. Going too fast into the bend could cause you to lose control. Braking late and harshly while changing direction reduces your vehicle’s grip on the road, and is likely to cause a skid.

image
yes
question
When approaching this bridge you should give way to
options
bicycles
buses
motorcycles
cars
extract
A double-deck bus or high-sided lorry will have to take up a position in the centre of the road so that it can clear the bridge. There is normally a sign to indicate this. Look well down the road, through the bridge and be aware you may have to stop and give way to an oncoming large vehicle.
image
yes
question
Why must you take extra care when turning right at this junction?
options
Road surface is poor
Footpaths are narrow
Road markings are faint
There is reduced visibility

yes
question
At this blind junction you must stop
options
behind the line, then edge forward to see clearly
beyond the line at a point where you can see clearly
only if there is traffic on the main road
only if you are turning to the right
extract
The ‘stop’ sign has been put here because there is a poor view into the main road. You must stop because it will not be possible to assess the situation on the move, however slowly you are travelling.
image
yes
question
An elderly person’s driving ability could be affected because they may be unable to

You are planning a long journey. Do you need to plan rest stops?
options
Yes, you should plan to stop every half an hour
Yes, regular stops help concentration
No, you will be less tired if you get there as soon as possible
No, only fuel stops will be needed
extract
Try to plan your journey so that you can take rest stops. It’s recommended that you take a break of at least 15 minutes after every two hours of driving. This should help to maintain your concentration.
image
no
question
The red lights are flashing. What should you do when approaching this level crossing?
options
Go through quickly
Go through carefully
Stop before the barrier
Switch on hazard warning lights
extract
At level crossings the red lights flash before and when the barrier is down. At most crossings an amber light will precede the red lights. You must stop behind the white line unless you have already crossed it when the amber light comes on. NEVER zigzag around half-barriers.
image
yes
question
A driver does something that upsets you. You should
options
try not to react
let them know how you feel
flash your headlights several times
sound your horn
extract
There are times when other road users make a misjudgement or mistake. When this happens try not to get annoyed and don’t react by showing anger. Sounding your horn, flashing your headlights or shouting won’t help the situation. Good anticipation will help to prevent these incidents becoming collisions.

no
question
What should the driver of the red car (arrowed) do?
options
Wave the pedestrians who are waiting to cross
Wait for the pedestrian in the road to cross
Quickly drive behind the pedestrian in the road
Tell the pedestrian in the road she should not have crossed
extract
Some people might take longer to cross the road. They may be older or have a disability. Be patient and don’t hurry them by showing your impatience. They might have poor eyesight or not be able to hear traffic approaching. If pedestrians are standing at the side of the road, don’t signal or wave them to cross. Other road users may not have seen your signal and this could lead the pedestrians into a hazardous situation.

yes
question
You are following a slower-moving vehicle on a narrow country road. There is a junction just ahead on the right. What should you do?
options
Overtake after checking your mirrors and signalling
Stay behind until you are past the junction
Accelerate quickly to pass before the junction
Slow down and prepare to overtake on the left
extract
You should never overtake as you approach a junction. If a vehicle emerged from the junction while you were overtaking, a dangerous situation could develop very quickly.
image
no
question
Why are mirrors often slightly curved (convex)?
options
They give a wider field of vision
They totally cover blind spots
They make it easier to judge the speed of following traffic
They make following traffic look bigger
extract
Although a convex mirror gives a wide view of the scene behind, you should be aware that it will not show you everything behind or to the side of the vehicle. Before you move off you will need to check over your shoulder to look for anything not visible in the mirrors.

options
Glare from the sun may affect the driver’s vision
The black car may stop suddenly
The bus may move out into the road
Oncoming vehicles will assume the driver is turning right
extract
If you can do so safely give way to buses signalling to move off at bus stops. Try to anticipate the actions of other road users around you. The driver of the red car should be prepared for the bus pulling out. As you approach a bus stop look to see how many passengers are waiting to board. If the last one has just got on, the bus is likely to move off.
image
yes

What TWO main hazards should you be aware of when going along this street?
options
Glare from the sun
Car doors opening suddenly
Lack of road markings
The headlights on parked cars being switched on
Large goods vehicles
Children running out from between vehicles
extract
On roads where there are many parked vehicles you should take extra care. You might not be able to see children between parked cars and they may run out into the road without looking. People may open car doors without realising the hazard this can create. You will also need to look well down the road for oncoming traffic.
image
yes
question
A driver’s behaviour has upset you. It may help if you
options
stop and take a break
shout abusive language
gesture to them with your hand
follow their car, flashing your headlights

image
yes
question
In areas where there are ‘traffic calming’ measures you should
options
travel at a reduced speed
always travel at the speed limit
position in the centre of the road
only slow down if pedestrians are near
extract
Traffic calming measures such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings are intended to slow you down. Maintain a reduced speed until you reach the end of these features. They are there to protect pedestrians. Kill your speed!
image
no
question
When approaching this hazard why should you slow down?
options
Because of the bend
Because it’s hard to see to the right
Because of approaching traffic
Because of animals crossing
Because of the level crossing
extract
There are two hazards clearly signed in this picture. You should be preparing for the bend by slowing down and selecting the correct gear. You might also have to stop at the level crossing, so be alert and be prepared to stop if necessary.
image
yes
question
Some two-way roads are divided into three lanes. Why are these particularly dangerous?
options
Traffic in both directions can use the middle lane to overtake
Traffic can travel faster in poor weather conditions
Traffic can overtake on the left
Traffic uses the middle lane for emergencies only
extract
If you intend to overtake you must consider that approaching traffic could be planning the same manoeuvre. When you have considered the situation and have decided it is safe, indicate your intentions early. This will show the approaching traffic that you intend to pull out.
image
no
question
Why are place names painted on the road surface?
options
To restrict the flow of traffic
To warn you of oncoming traffic
To enable you to change lanes early
To prevent you changing lanes
extract
The names of towns and cities may be painted on the road at busy junctions and complex road systems. Their purpose is to let you move into the correct lane in good time, allowing traffic to flow more freely.
