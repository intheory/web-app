           				InTheory was created to make a boring experience <strong>faster</strong> and <strong>more fun</strong><br />

						Learning for your driving theory is dull, but, if you want to get out on the road, you need to do it. We believe that that way you learn for your test can be made much, much better; that's why we created InTheory.co.uk in September 2012. We really hope you enjoy what we've built, and pass first time.
